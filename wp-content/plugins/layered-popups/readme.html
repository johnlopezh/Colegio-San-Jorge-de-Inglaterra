<h3>Intro</h3>
Internet is full of boring popups. So, it's a time to break this trend. That's why I created "Layered Popups". With this plugin you can realize your imagination and make unique multi-layers popup windows. You can create multiple layers with whatever-you-want content and add custom transitions/animations for each layer. You can embed AJAX-ed subscription form which works with autoresponders (MailChimp, GetResponse, iContact, Campaign Monitor) and collect users' names/e-mails. You can raise popup window on page load or show it on click event. You can make your website more attractive and pay users attention to certain stuff.

<h3>Demo</h3>
Please visit <a href="http://halfdata.com/milkyway/layered-popups.html">this page</a> and check out demo popups. With "Layered Popups" plugin you can create your own popups. You are limited only by imagination. :-)
